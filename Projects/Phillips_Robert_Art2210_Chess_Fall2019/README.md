## Designer Statement(s)

My original 3rd project is an update on the second project with preloaded graphics and an updated scoring system.  That only took a couple of hours, so I decided to also try and make a working chess game.

That project was impossible!  I started off by just using a nested for loop to create the grid pattern, then created a border around that.  After that I created a separate class for each type of piece.  Inside of that I had two separate functions to show it's location on the board and to highlight the possible moves the piece could make.  I unfortunately couldn't get the pieces to move properly!
